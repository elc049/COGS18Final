# COGS18Final
This project focuses on class inheritance and interactions between artificial agents. Within the notebook, you can create and run a "board" with a number of animals (butterfly, bird, snake) as you desire and watch how they interact within a certain number of turns. The animals all move in unique ways and can be "eaten" by other animals. This project was made for COGS 18, Fall 2018.
